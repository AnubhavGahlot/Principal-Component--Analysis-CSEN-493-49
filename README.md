# Principal-Component-Analysis-CSEN-493-49

Course Code: CSEN 493-49

Overview:
This project explores how Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can effectively reduce the size of Internet of Things (IoT) data without compromising accuracy. With IoT data growing rapidly, efficient data handling methods are crucial for storage, processing, and transmission.

Objectives:

Understand PCA fundamentals and its applicability in data dimensionality reduction.
Analyze IoT data characteristics and challenges.
Implement PCA algorithms tailored for IoT datasets.
Evaluate PCA-based compression techniques in terms of data size reduction and accuracy preservation.
Compare PCA-based approaches with traditional IoT data compression methods.
Explore potential applications of PCA-based data reduction in IoT systems.
Methodology:

Literature Review: Review PCA, data compression techniques, and IoT data characteristics.
